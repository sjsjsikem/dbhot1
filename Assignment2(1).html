	<h3>History of computers</h3>
	
	<p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word-spacing;">Since the evolution of humans, devices have been used for <b><i>calculations</i></b> for thousands of years. One of the earliest and most well-known devices was an abacus. Then in 1822, the father of computers, Charles Babbage began developing what would be the first mechanical computer. And then in 1833 he actually designed an Analytical Engine which was a general-purpose computer. It contained an ALU, some basic flow chart principles and the concept of integrated memory.</p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word-spacing;">Then more than a century later in the history of computers, we got our first electronic computer for general purpose. It was the ENIAC, which stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer. The inventors of this computer were John W. Mauchly and J.Presper Eckert.</p>

     <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word-spacing;">And with times the technology developed and the computers got smaller and the processing got faster. We got our first laptop in 1981 and it was introduced by Adam Osborne and EPSON.</p>
	
	<h4>Generations of Computers</h4>
	
	<p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word-spacing;">In the history of computers, we often refer to the advancements of modern computers as the generation of computers. We are currently on the fifth generation of computers. So let us look at the important features of these five generations of computers:</p>
	
	<p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word-spacing;padding:0 2em;color:red"><b>1st Generation: </b>This was from the period of 1940 to 1955. This was when machine language was developed for the use of computers. They used vacuum tubes for the circuitry. For the purpose of memory, they used magnetic drums. These machines were complicated, large, and expensive. They were mostly reliant on batch operating systems and punch cards. As output and input devices, magnetic tape and paper tape were implemented. For example, ENIAC, UNIVAC-1, EDVAC, and so on.</p>
	
	<p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word-spacing;padding:0 2em;"><b>2nd Generation: </b>The years 1957-1963 were referred to as the “second generation of computers” at the time. In second-generation computers, COBOL and FORTRAN are employed as assembly languages and programming languages. Here they advanced from vacuum tubes to transistors. This made the computers smaller, faster and more energy-efficient. And they advanced from binary to assembly languages. For instance, IBM 1620, IBM 7094, CDC 1604, CDC 3600, and so forth.</p>
	
	<p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word-spacing;padding:0 2em;"><b>3rd Generation: </b>The hallmark of this period (1964-1971) was the development of the integrated circuit.  A single integrated circuit (IC) is made up of many transistors, which increases the power of a computer while simultaneously lowering its cost. These computers were quicker, smaller, more reliable, and less expensive than their predecessors. High-level programming languages such as FORTRON-II to IV, COBOL, and PASCAL PL/1 were utilized. For example, the IBM-360 series, the Honeywell-6000 series, and the IBM-370/168.</p>
	
	<h3>Computer Parts</h3>
	
	<h4><b>Central Procwssing Unit</b></h4>

Its electronic circuitry executes instructions of a computer program, such as arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations. This role contrasts with that of external components, such as main memory and I/O circuitry,[1] and specialized coprocessors such as graphics processing units(GPUs).</p>
