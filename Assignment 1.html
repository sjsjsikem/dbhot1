	<p>The <b>Internet</b> is a global system of interconnected computer networks that
use the
standard Internet protocol suite(TCP/IP) to link several billion devices worldwide. It is a <em><span style="color:#B22222">network of networks</span></em> that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents
and applications of the World Wide Web(WWW),
the infrastructure to support email, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing and telephony.</p>
	
	<p>The origins of
the Internet date back to research commissioned by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States" style="color:black;text-decoration:none">United States</a> government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via computer
networks.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet#cite_note-2" style="color:black;text-decoration:none">[2]</a> This work, combined with work in the United Kingdom and France, led to the primary precursor network, the ARPANET, in the United States. A 1980 paper refers to "the ARPA internet". The <span style="color:red">interconnection of regional academic networks in the 1980s marks the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet.</span> From the early 1990s, the network experienced sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were connected to it.</p>
