	<!-- <p>The <b>Internet</b> is a global system of interconnected computer networks that -->
<!-- use the -->
<!-- standard Internet protocol suite(TCP/IP) to link several billion devices worldwide. It is a <em><span style="color:red">network of networks<span></em> that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents -->
<!-- and applications of the World Wide Web(WWW), -->
<!-- the infrastructure to support email, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing and telephony.</p> -->
	
	<!-- <p>The origins of -->
<!-- the Internet date back to research commissioned by the United States government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via computer -->
<!-- networks.[2] This work, combined with work in the United Kingdom and France, led to the primary precursor network, the ARPANET, in the United States. A 1980 paper refers to "the ARPA internet". The <p style="color:red">interconnection of regional academic networks in the 1980s marks the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet.</p> From the early 1990s, the network experienced sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were connected to it.</p> -->
